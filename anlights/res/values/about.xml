        version 0.1\n
        - initial release\n
        \n
        AnLights is a simple Light control application for Android. It currently only supports the
        Philips Hue lighting system.\n
        \n
        It provides simple one touch control of all your hue lights.\n
        \n
        Current limitations:\n
        - it only connects to the first hue-bridge it finds\n
        - it controls all lights at the same time\n
        - it only allows to control brightness and color temperature\n
        \n
        On the up-side, this little functionality should be easy to use.\n
        \n
        Advanced topics:\n
        Connecting to the hue bridge - In case the application is not already registered, the
        registration process is automatically started either at startup or when a light update is
        issued and the response indicates missing authorization.\n
        \n
        Deleting bridge users - When selecting this option, the application will delete all
        white-listed hue users from the bridge that where created by anlights. This will also
        include users created by other devices.\n
